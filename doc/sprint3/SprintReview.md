# Sprint Review With Product Owner

### Not fulfilled:
- Whitebox test for getting PDF document and Bibtex
- When clicking on a conference name, a newly generated list should also have frequency
- Whitebox test for exporting list of papers as PDF and plain text
- Blackbox and Whitebox tests for keyword searches (should test for multiple word searches)
- Blackbox and Whitebox tests for highlighted words in the abstract and highlighted PDF
- The highlighted PDF shouldn't be a new PDF; it should use the existing PDF from the digital libraries and highlight the words over the existing PDF
