# Sprint Review With Product Owner

### Not fulfilled:
#### Features
- When clicking on a conference name, a newly generated list should also have frequency
- The highlighted PDF shouldn't be a new PDF; it should use the existing PDF from the digital libraries and highlight the words over the existing PDF

#### Whitebox
- Whitebox test for getting PDF document and Bibtex
- Whitebox test for exporting list of papers as PDF and plain text
- Whitebox test for keyword searches (should test for multiple word searches)
- Whitebox test for highlighted words in the abstract and highlighted PDF

#### Blackbox
- Blackbox test for keyword searches (should test for multiple word searches)
- Blackbox test for highlighted words in the abstract and highlighted PDF

#### Process Feedback
- There should be proofs to show the code is indeed improved after refactoring (some comparisons)
- Missing details of when the bug occurred and when the test cases were created
