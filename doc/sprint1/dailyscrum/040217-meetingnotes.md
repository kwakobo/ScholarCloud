### Questions
1. What did you do since last meeting?
2. What is getting in your way?
3. What will you do until the next meeting?

### Bryce, Jeffrey
1. Got the abstract doc for each ACM article.
2. The paragraph are separated in different html tag and for some reason are not being detected
3. Fix the bug for getting ACM articles' abstract.

### Jason, Mi Hyun
1. Reused the word frequency counter from the previous project, integrated the digital library APIs with word cloud API, generated list of papers associated with word clicked, stored and displayed article pdf link and bibtex
2. PDF parser doesn't parse certain documents; ACM digital library doesn't have the abstract that we want;
3. Work on ACM digital library abstract

### Taylor, Quinn
1. Since last meeting we discussed the potential of switching to reuse word frequency code written for project one, so we worked on ensuring that code could be reused for this new purpose.
2. Some of our variables/tasks revolved around a link that the parser files held, but the link storage was done successfully by other pairs.
3. Until next meeting we will continue integrating all the separate parts into a join system we can demo on Monday
