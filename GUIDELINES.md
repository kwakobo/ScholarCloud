# Guidelines For Pair Programming

## Steps
1) Commit pair programming picture evidence
2) Commit developed test cases in PHPUnit for the parts that you are going to implement
3) Commit implementation
4) For every bug found during implementation, create a new test case
5) Look for problems in the code or something to improve upon (refactor) and state the problem or the improve you will be making in a .md file
6) Commit the fix/improvement for #5
7) If done with specific functionality, implement tests
7) Run both black box and white box tests and commit the screenshot of the results for ALL tests

## Naming schemes for certain files and file locations

#### Pair Programming Picture
- mmddyy-name1-name2.jpg
- Example: 032717-jason-mihyun.jpg
- commit it under docs/sprint2/PairProgrammingPictures
#### Refactoring Statement
- mmddyy-refactoring.md
- commit it under docs/sprint2/Refactor
#### Running Tests
- Each pair should create a directory under the pair's names: docs/sprint2/testevidence/name1-name2
- mmddyy-testtype-testname.jpg
- Example: 032717-whitebox-search.jpg
- commit it under the pair's folder in docs/sprint2/testevidence/
