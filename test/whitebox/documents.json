The GIMP is a free, robust, powerful\nprogram for painting, image processing, and manipulating pictures. If\nyou enjoy using Adobes Photoshop\u00c2\u00ae program, youll love the GIMP. The\nGIMP is a project of Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley. It began as a compiler class\nproject in LISP. Frustration with the program, plus system crashes,\npushed the project in a new direction. Instead of LISP, the students\ndecided to write an image manipulation project in C. The result has\nquickly grown into a full-fledged image editing program.\n\nOne critical aspect of the GIMP is that it is free software. It is\nreleased under the General Public License of the Free Software\nFoundation. That means that you can always obtain the source to the\nprogram. Furthermore, it is free for downloading over the Internet.\nThe GIMP fills the need for a free Photoshop\u00c2\u00ae-like program. The tool\nis available for most UNIX platforms. Binary versions are available\nfor Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, SGIs IRIX, Linux, and FreeBSD. Since the\nprogram is written for UNIX, youre out of luck if you only have access\nto Microsoft Windows or Apple Macintosh machines.\n\nIf you do install and run the GIMP, youll find that it is packed with\nfeatures. Paint tools include a paintbrush, airbrush, text tools,\nclone, blur, and sharpen. You can also transform images with rotation,\nscaling, flipping, and shearing. The GIMP supports many common file\nformats: TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, PPM, etc. Selections can be performed\nwith rectangle, ellipse, and freehand tools. If thats not enough, you\ncan use intelligent scissors, fuzzy selection by color, and even\nbezier selection. The program supports a full host of channel\noperations and many types of displays from 8 bit to 24 bit. Newer beta\nversions of the program support layers, transparency, and scripts to\nautomatically generate logos and other images. Soon the program may be\nable to operate with graphics tablets.\n\nOne fantastic feature is the ability to use PLUG-INS, which let users\ncreate their own custom features and special effects. Volunteers and\nthe GIMP enthusiasts have written close to a hundred different\nplug-ins including pinch, despeckle, oilify, plasma, map to sphere,\nfade, mosaic, line integral convolution, motion blur, engrave, page\ncurl, sparkle, checkerboard, lens flare, displace, lunarize,\nde-interlace, and extrude. Users can get these plug-ins from the Web\neasily or write their own.\n\n HOW DO I GET IT? \n\nYoure probably wondering how to get the GIMP and try it out. You can\ndownload binary code for many platforms from the GIMPs home page (see\nhttp:\/\/www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU\/~gimp\/). The file will appear something\nlike \"gimp-0.54-linux-ELF-bin.tar.gz\" and will be quite large. You\nwill want to untar the program with a command like \"tar zxvf\ngimp-0.54-linux-ELF-bin.tar.gz\". If your version of tar is old, you\ncan execute \"gzip -cd gimp-0.54-linux-ELF-bin.tar.gz | tar xvf -\".\nOnce the program is unpacked, change into the \"gimp\" directory. Youll\nsee README files and a file called \"gimprc\". You should execute \"cp\ngimprc ~\/.gimprc\" to make a copy of your own gimp configuration file.\nYoull need to edit ~\/.gimprc to add the path where you unpacked the\ndirectory. Alternatively, you can try the program out by running\n\"gimp\" while you are in the gimp directory.\n\n HOW DO I USE IT? \n\nWhen you run the program for the first time, you will see the main\napplication \"toolbox.\" From this menu you can perform most of the\nGIMPs operations. You will also see the menus for files operations.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1 shows the main menu with some of the buttons labeled. The\nselection tools are near the top of the dialog, while other tools fill\nout the other rows. The tools that are built into GIMP on the main\nmenu include moving, magnification, cropping, transforming, flipping,\ntext, color picking, fill, blending, pencil, paintbrush, eraser,\nairbrush, clone and convolve. Once you open an image, it will appear\nin its own window. The menus can be accessed quickly by clicking the\nright mouse button while over the image. Plug-ins are also accessed\nwith the right mouse button or with keyboard short-cuts (also found in\nthe ~\/.gimprc file). You will find that most tools operate like other\nimage manipulation programs you may have used before. GIMP is\nstructured in this way to make operations more familiar and easier to\nuse. With a little practice, you can be editing images very quickly.\nYou can also access a variety of tutorials on GIMP over the Web, as\nyou will discover in the next section.\n\nLets do a simple task right now so you can see how easy it is to start\nusing the GIMP. Lets create an effect known as a \"drop shadow\" for a\nrectangular image. A drop shadow looks like a blurry shadow underneath\nan image. It helps add depth to a picture. You can see the before and\nafter images below.\n\n [http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpf2a.jpg]\nFIGURE 2 [white padding]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpf2b.jpg]\n\nFirst we need an image. I started with a picture of a campus landmark\nat my university. One nice feature about the GIMP is that you can\nreach all of its functions by clicking with the right button on the\nimage to bring up a pop-up menu that looks like this:\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nFrom the menu shown in Figure 5, you can probe further down into more\nchoices. For example, to make sure the image is full-color, you should\nmove the mouse to select \"Filters,\" then \"Conversions,\" and finally\n\"To Color.\" We will abbreviate this procedure as\n\"Filters->Conversions->To Color.\" Assuming that you have just opened\nan image and made sure that it is full-color, were ready to start.\n\nFirst, you need some padding around your image. Execute \"File->New\" on\nthe original image and pad the width and height by 100 pixels or so.\nSelect RGB for the image type. This creates a new, larger image with a\nwhite background. For the next step, we want to execute\n\"Select->Select All\" and then \"Edit->Copy\" on the original image. Move\nto the newly created white image and execute \"Edit->Paste.\" Now you\nshould have an image with some white padding around it:\n\n[figure]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpimga.jpg]\nImage A\n\nWell label this first padded image Image A. Now execute\n\"Filters->Channel Ops->Duplicate.\" Note that you get a copy of Image\nA. Well use that copy later. The first version of Image A should have\na moving border around the inner image. That border is sometimes\ncalled \"marching ants,\" and it represents a part of the image which is\nselected. Now we want to fill the selection with solid black, so\nexecute \"Tools->Bucket Fill.\" Then click the left button of the mouse\ninside the selection and it will be filled with solid black:\n\n[figure]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpimgb.jpg]\nImage B\n\nWere halfway done. By executing \"Filters->Channel Ops->Offset\" on\nImage B and selecting an X and Y displacement of about 20 pixels in\neach direction, we get an image where the black rectangle has moved\nsome:\n\n[figure]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpimgc.jpg]\nImage C\n\nTo make the shadow of the picture blurry, do the command\n\"Filters->Blur->Gaussian Blur\" and use a radius of about 8.0 pixels.\nThe result will look like Image D:\n\n[figure]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpimgd.jpg]Image\nD\n\nNow we are ready to make our final image. Execute \"Filters->Channel\nOps->Composite.\" Our goal is to composite our copy of Image A with\nImage D using Image B as our mask. The mask will take the pixels from\nImage A where Image B is black and take pixels from Image D where\nImage B is white. The composite window will have pull-down menus for\nyour choices. Look at the titlebars to find which actual images\ncorrespond to Images A, B, and D. When you click \"OK,\" youll get the\nfinal result:\n\n[figure]\n[http:\/\/deliveryimages.acm.org\/10.1145\/280000\/270972\/gfx\/gimpimge.jpg]Final\nImage\n\nNow you can create a drop shadow anytime! Youll discover that practice\nmakes everything easier and that keyboard shortcuts exist for most\ncommon operations. After a little while using the GIMP, you could\nprobably create a drop shadow in just a few seconds. Also notice that\nyou can experiment with all kinds of variations like shadows of\nirregularly shaped selections or different colors. In the future, the\nGIMP will allow scripting of common sequences of commands. This might\nlet you built a drop shadow macro that works with just a keystroke. If\nyou like the power and flexibility of the GIMP, the information in the\nnext section will help you get started and show you where to find more\nideas and other tutorials.\n\n WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFO? \n\nSince the growth of the GIMP is due in large part to the Internet and\nthe Web, it shouldnt be surprising that quite a few sites devoted to\nthe GIMP exist. You can start at the GIMPs official home page at\nhttp:\/\/www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU\/~gimp\/ to find stable source code, whats\nnew with the program, screen shots, and some tutorials. The authors\ndeserve lots of credit for making such a powerful program a reality\nand then releasing it for general usage. You can find links at\nhttp:\/\/abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu\/~nem\/gimp\/tuts for even more\ntutorials.\n\nAn abundance of GIMP pages can be found using your favorite search\nengine. One good place to start is the \"Everybody loves The GIMP\" page\nat http:\/\/luthien.nuclecu.unam.mx\/~federico\/gimp\/index.html, by\nFederico Mena Quintero. Besides a source tree for newer versions of\nthe GIMP, you can find tons of links to other resources: mailing\nlists, plug-ins, other peoples pages, and tutorials. The page is also\nupdated quite often. Another good page is by Zach Beane at\nhttp:\/\/xach.dornet.com.xach.html.\n\nFor developers interested in writing a plug-in, you should visit the\nGIMP Plug-in Registry by Adam Moss at\nhttp:\/\/www.worldserver.pipex.com\/home\/adam\/gimp\/plug.html first. This\npage has a list of the current plug-ins that are available, so you can\ncheck if the effect you want has already been written. Along with\nshort descriptions of what each filter does, you can find out who\nwrote the plug-in and when. Binaries are available for Linux and you\ncan download source code from this site too. In case you decide to\ndesign your own plug-in, another useful page can be found at\nhttp:\/\/www2.ai-lab.fh-furtwangen.de\/~bless\/the-gimp.html. This site,\nmaintained by Marc Bless, has pointers to the GIMP Programmers\nReference Book. The documentation covers most aspects of writing a\nplug-in and even has complete templates. You can retrieve the\ninformation in HTML, SGML, PostScript, and .dvi formats.\n\nThe web has many more great GIMP pages than I could possibly mention.\nYou should take an hour to investigate all the wonderful pages created\npeople around the world about the GIMP. The time you spend exploring\nthe GIMP and its uses can be immensely entertaining and yet\neducational too.\n\nMatt Cutts (cutts@cs.unc.edu) is a doctoral student in the Computer\nScience department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nHis research areas include graphics, computer vision, and novel ways\nof getting input to a \"box\" and output from a \"box.\" He is interested\nin different ways to make information clearer to people, and to allow\npeople to communicate in a more intuitive fashion.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThere are no comments at this time.\n \u00c2\u00a0\nTo comment you must create or log in with your ACM account\n[\/signin.cfm].\n\nAbout XRDS [\/about.cfm] | About the Editors [\/aboutus.cfm] | Renew\nMembership [http:\/\/www.acm.org\/renew] | Subscribe\n[https:\/\/campus.acm.org\/public\/qj\/GenPUBQJ\/PUBLIST\/genpubqj_publist.cfm]\n| Sign In [\/signin.cfm] | Information for Authors\n[\/authorguidelines.cfm] | Privacy [\/privacy.cfm] | Site Map\n[\/sitemap.cfm] | Help [\/help.cfm] | Contact Us [\/contact.cfm] |\nAdvertise [http:\/\/acm-media.org\/]\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2017 by the ACM.
